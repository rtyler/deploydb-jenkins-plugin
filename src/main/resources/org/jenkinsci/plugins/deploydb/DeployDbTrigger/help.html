  If enabled, any webhooks received by Jenkins from a DeployDB instance will be
  evaluated against the event types configured below.<br/>
  If the incoming webhook matches one or more of the configured event types, and
  the service name matches, then a build of this job will be triggered.
  <p/>
  Once the execution of a DeployDB-triggered build completes, its status will be
  reported back to DeployDB.
