<div>
  Enter the name of a DeployDB service, or a regular expression, if builds of
  this job may be triggered by multiple different services.
  <p/>
  If using a regular expression, it must match the <em>entire</em> service name,
  i.e. "<tt>^foo</tt>" is not enough to match the service name "<tt>foobar</tt>".
